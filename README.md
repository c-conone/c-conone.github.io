# Tools and Technologies for Business Analytics Assignments  

The Tools and Technologies for Business Analytics assignments focus on practical applications of data transformation, statistical modeling, and reproducible workflow design. The work progresses from cleaning transactional datasets to calculating safety stock levels using service level coefficients, highlighting reproducible, well‑documented approaches for turning raw data into actionable insights in supply chain and inventory management.


### Assignment 1: Data Preparation for Safety Stock Analysis  

This assignment demonstrates the ability to prepare transactional data for inventory analysis by standardizing inconsistent column names, correcting anomalies in numeric features, and filtering the dataset for Make to Stock (MTS) SKUs. The analysis surfaces operational insights such as counts of unique SKUs, manufacturing sites, and divisions, while also identifying top and bottom transactions by order quantity with calculated sales values.  

### Assignment 2: Safety Stock Calculation and Distribution Analysis  

This project showcases statistical modeling by calculating safety stock levels for MTS SKUs using service level coefficients. Lead time statistics—including minimum, maximum, mean, median, variance, and standard deviation—are aggregated, and safety stock is computed using z-scores for 75%, 90%, and 95% service levels. The results highlight SKUs with the highest and lowest requirements and provide a clear view of average safety stock values across all SKUs.

# Advanced Visual Analytics Assignments & Project

The Advanced Visual Analytics assignments focus on developing a predictive cost estimation model for WD-40’s transportation operations. Using historical shipment and invoice data, the work supports strategic decision-making across finance, procurement, and supply chain leadership by combining feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and advanced visualization.


### Assignment 1: Context Artifacts and Problem Framing
This assignment demonstrates the design of a predictive model that addresses WD-40’s (hypothetical)transportation cost challenges, where delayed invoices hinder timely budgeting and forecasting. The project defines scope and stakeholder priorities, reviews procurement workflows, and analyzes shipment and invoice data to surface anomalies. Features such as shipment details, invoice amounts, and derived delay metrics feed into a model that integrates seamlessly into planning workflows. A storyboard outlines dashboard development steps and success criteria, supported by a narrative that emphasizes cost visibility and proactive decision-making.  

### Assignment 2: Delay Feature Engineering and Exploratory Analysis  

This phase highlights feature engineering and exploratory analysis using a stakeholder-provided dataset of shipments and invoices across sites, regions, and transportation modes. The work compares dataset expectations to assumptions, assesses completeness, and summarizes invoice amounts. Visual insights illustrate transportation volume by site and region and mode utilization trends. Delay features are engineered from shipping and invoice dates, then explored across regions, sites, and invoice amounts, with distributions analyzed by transportation mode.  

### Assignment 3: Delay-by-Mode and Invoice Time Series Forecasting  

This assignment demonstrates advanced visualization and forecasting by expanding delay analysis across transportation modes. Ordered boxplots with refined themes and labels present delay distributions, while time-series analysis of invoice data uncovers seasonality and trends through small multiples. Final visuals are exported for stakeholder review, and forecasting insights evaluate the potential for predictive cost estimation by comparing observed patterns across transportation modes.  


### Power BI Dashboard Project: Aviation Accident Trends in California (2019)

This project analyzed aviation accident trends in California during 2019 using Python for data cleaning and visualization and Power BI for interactive reporting, to discover key insights into possible factors contributing to aviation accidents. The Python workflow prepared and merged flight and accident datasets, producing bar charts of monthly accidents and findings across aircraft, environmental, and human factors. The Power BI dashboard integrated cleaned data into fact and dimension tables, applied DAX measures, and delivered multi‑page visuals with slicers and definitions, illustrating how raw data can be transformed into meaningful, actionable insights.
